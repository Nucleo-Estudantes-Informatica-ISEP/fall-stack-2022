# FALL STACK 2022

## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Fall Stack event's GitHub repository. Here you'll find everything you need to contribute with your amazing code and ideas!

This is a NÃºcleo de Estudantes de InformÃ¡tica project, made by students from ISEP.

## Description

Fall Stack is a tech event that happens every year with the intention of presenting tech companies to students that are looking for an internship.

This is also a great place for networking and really getting to know the market.

The event takes place in ISEP (Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto) in the 19th and 20th of December.

## Tech stack

The previous website was made using pure HTML & CSS, as we love to suffer, but, in this edition, we decided to hop in the modern web dev trends with **ReactJS**.

Using a component driven approach, every bit of the website is divided in little chunks of code, making the development and maintainment much easier.

For styling, we're using the "utility-first CSS framework" **TailwindCSS**.

## Bootstrap the project

To start using the project you got to install a **text editor**, such as Visual Studio Code, and a few technologies:

- **NodeJS**
- **Yarn**

> It's also important that you install Prettier in your text editor to automatically format the code according to the project's needs

### Cloning the project

Using git

```
git clone https://github.com/Nucleo-Estudantes-Informatica-ISEP/fall-stack-2022.git
```

Using GitHub CLI

```
gh repo clone Nucleo-Estudantes-Informatica-ISEP/fall-stack-2022
```

### Starting the project

In your local machine, open your terminal and type the following command:

```
yarn run dev
```

This will start vite automatically in your local machine and reload the assets every time you make a change in your code. Vite is indeed amazing.

### Contributing to the project

In order to contribute to the project, you should look into the document provided in the team's Notion.
All the informations related to branches naming and code styling is in there.
